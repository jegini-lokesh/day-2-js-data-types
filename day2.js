//Note:js data type are dynamic data typeswe did not assigin data type to variable it will automatically decide data type based on value assigin to variable
//In Js we have 5 types of data types are present
//1)number (in js we dont have int and float concept)
//2)srting
//3) boolean type
//4)undefine
//5)null
var a = 20; //this also number
var b = 30.5; //this also number
console.log(typeof a);
console.log(typeof b)
    //2)string data type//note we can represent string in single or double quotes
var c = "loki"
var d = "murali"
console.log(typeof c)
var e = c + d; //concardination
console.log(e)
console.log(typeof e)
var f = 16 + "loki" //even one string present also it act as concardination
console.log(typeof e)
    //boolean type(note here small letters only)
var g = 30;
var h = 30;
var i = g == h;
console.log(typeof i)
console.log(i)
    //4)undefined
var j;
console.log(j)
console.log(typeof j)
    //5)null this is not under stand to me when i use typeof k it shows undefine data type with out showing null
var k =
    console.log(typeof k)
